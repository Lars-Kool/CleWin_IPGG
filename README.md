# CleWin_IPGG

by Lars Kool, Plateforme Technologique d'Institut Pierre-Gilles de Gennes

This repository contains a library of basic shapes (and the code to create them) that can be used to assemble bigger and more complex microfluidic channels. All shapes are are parametric (i.e. you can change some parameters to change the shape, rather than having to redraw them).

This repository contains 3 repositories:
- doc : Documentation of the shapes and their input parameters, as well as instructions on how to load the library, and change the parameters of the shapes
- rsc : Images used for the documentation
- src : CleWin-C source-code to build the shapes (to preserve and track the history of the code)

For more details on the repository, e.g. on how to download and add it to CleWin, see the Manual in the doc folder.
